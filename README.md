- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making websites that make a meaningful impact to people's daily lives. Examples include nutrition and budget tracking. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently developing two major projects.
Checkout [MyNutrition](https://github.com/RogueStar112/MyNutrition)
and [MyBudget](https://github.com/RogueStar112/MyBudget-May2024)

- Also checkout my [portfolio website](demie-mistica.com). I make [blog articles](https://www.demie-mistica.com/#blog) there from time to time too!
